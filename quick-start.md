# Quick start

In this guide we will see how to start the [Initium Platform](https://github.com/nearform/initium-platform) locally and deploy there from a github action using the [Initium cli](https://github.com/nearform/initium-cli).

## Prerequisites

The Initium Platform uses `kind` so you need at least a way to run Docker.

We use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to install the remanining tools.

## The Platform

1. Clone the platform repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nearform/initium-platform.git
```

2. Install the required tooling

```bash
cd initium-platform
make asdf_install
```

3. Start the platform

```bash
make
```

4. Wait for the initum-platform to be ready in the Tilt interface.

## The CLI

Download the lastest release of the cli for your operationg system [here](https://github.com/nearform/initium-cli/releases).

1. Fork the Initium [nodejs demo app](https://github.com/nearform/initium-nodejs-demo-app)

```

```
